What is GIT commit?
  //Git works by saving the current state of all of its files it manages into a snapshot called commits
  //snapshots are commits
  //one or more file changes
  //It is important to note that git versions files not folders.

 How to create a new git repository locally?
    mkdir projects
    cd projects
    git init demo
    Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/soumyasurajita/Desktop/git/projects/demo/.git/
    cd demo
    ls -al
    //we will see only .git folder
    
 What are the local git states?
    //It has 3 states
    1.working directory 
      //Working directory contains all the files and folders for your application.
       which may or may not be managed by git.
    2.staging area
      //used to prepare for next commit.
      //Files are moved form the modified working directory to git staging area and finally committed to git repository.
    3.repository(.git folder)
      //git repository or commit history contains all the committed or saved changes to the git repository
      //Anything here is a part of git history
      
First commit in git?
  //cd demo
  //cat README.md
  //Add below content to file and save it.
  # Demo Project
  This is a simple README file
  //ls
  README.md
  //git status
  On branch master

  Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    .DS_Store
	  README.md
  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
  //git add README.md 
  //git status

How .git folder works after a commit?
  .git folder will keep the history of changes.
  We are not supposed to modify this .git folder.
  We should be very careful dealing with it.
  
  If we delete .git folder from our demo project lets see what happens.
  //rm -rf .git
  //git status
  fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
  
  We can get .git folder back by using below git init command again.
  //cd demo
  //ls -al

  ** This is because we have deleted the .git repository.
    These particular files were being tracked by previous git repository.
    Now we have a brand new git repository hence these files showing as untracked.
    This version of the git repository has no prior knowledge of the README.md or .DS_STORE file.
