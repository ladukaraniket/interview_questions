	//3 - component, container, callback
Q. Can you tell me my component class render() method is triggered how many times?
	//On initial load first my constructor is going to trigger, then my render() method is going to trigger
	//state change also
	//on receiving new props as well

Q. How many types of components are available?
Q. Do we need to import react for functional components as well?
Q. What all things we get from React.Component class?
	//this.state, this.props, this.refs, this.setState(), render(), constructor() & life cycle methods
Q. Whatever a component receives from outside world or its parent can be received as?
	//this.props
Q. How many ways we can create variables within a class component?
	//let, const, this.varname , also state variable and props
Q. What is the difference between let, const, this.varname , this.state, this.props and this.refs?

Q. where my execution is going to start in react app?
	//My execution is always going to start from ReactDOM.render() method only


Q. How to handle a click event in react?
	//<input type='submit' value='Submit' onClick={this.showValue} />
	//Always we mention the function name , react will internally check if its a function it is going to call it..

Q. How many ways we can retrieve the values from a textbook?
	//ref and this.refs
	//onChange event - getting event.target.value and then saving it to a state variable

Q.










Q. What is <></> ?
Q. What is React.Fragment?

Q. What is the library required for routing?
	//react-router-dom
Q. How many ways we can achieve routing?
	//2 ways - HashRouting,  BrowserRouting
Q. What components are we using from “react-router-dom”?
	//HashRouter,BrowserRouter, Route
Q. Route component which attributes we use for routing?
	//path, component, exact etc..
Q. Difference between HashRouter and BrowserRouter?
	//We use anchor tags with href as “#/urlpath” for HashRouter
	//We use ul li without # i.e. Link to="/urlpath"

	Note :: the Router path should match exactly to this urlpath
Q. We have to wrap all Route configuration along with the anchors or all Route configuration along with the ul li inside a single wrapper div. Is it true or false?
	//true
Q. What is the difference between HashRouter and BrowserRouter?

Q. What is the difference between a class state variable and a function state variable(hooks)?
	//we always have to create an object in class state variable..
	//But we can use any value for functional state variable..
		number,string,object,array,boolean etc

	//Also in a class we can maintain any number of state variable..
	//But using useState() we create a single..

Q. What the useState() call do?
	//It returns an array with exactly 2 element
	//first element is current state name..we can just name it anything..
	//second element is the seState() method for this.. We can use any name

Q. Inside a functional component how we can display a state variable if below is the state?
	const [name,showName] = React.useState(“soumya”);
	//<div>{name}</div>

	const name = React.useState(“soumya”);
	//<div>{name[0]}</div>


	const [data,showData] = React.useState({a : 1, b : 2});
	//<div>{data.a}</div>




Q. How we can pass data from a parent to child?
	//parent omponent can pass using attribute while instantiating e.g. <child name="soumya" />
	//using this.props a child can receive e.g. {this.props.name}
	
Q. How we can pass data from a child to parent?
	//using event delegation
	//we can define a method in parent class with some arguments that child will be passing while calling this method
	//We pass this method like an attribute - same flow like parent to child..
		fnGetName(name){
			this.setState({name})
		}
		<child fnGetName={this.fnGetName} />
		
	//Inside child on any event for example button click we have the name and we have to send it to parent 
	//From child we will use this.props.fnGetName() and we can call this as a callback and pass the value...
		...
		fnsubmit(){
			this.props.fnGetName(this.refs.name.value)
		}
		render(){
			return <div>
					<input type="text" ref="name" />
					<input type="button" onClick={this.fnsubmit} /> 
				</div>
		}
		....
		
		
Q. From parent to child one level down we can get the data via this.props..
	But suppose I have a requirement like A -> ((B -> D -> E -> F -> G) , (C))
	multiple hierarchies are there...
	Suppose I want to pass data from A to G
	We are not going to pass data everytime to the children A to B , B to D , D to E, E to F and F to G..not a good idea.
	What is the solution?

	//We will go for context..
	
Q. So what are the steps involved while passing data using context?
	//3 steps React.createContext(), ctx.Provider, ctx.Consumer
	//1. We have to create the context..
		const ctx=React.createContext();
	//2. My parent component has to provide the data to the context
		<ctx.Provider value={this.name}>
                	<B />
             	</ctx.Provider>
	//3. All my remaining children components should have to consume the data from the context..
 		<ctx.Consumer>
                   {
                       (data)=>{
                            return <div>{data}</div>
                       }
                   }
                </ctx.Consumer>

Q.getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() returns what?//previous state values
Q. As a children if you want to know which props are coming to me then?
	//getDervivedStateFromProps()
	//componentWillReceiveProps()
Q.Why we go for context?//share data all my children
Q.What 3 things to remember for a context?
	//create the context, give the data, get the data
Q. How to create the context?//react.createContext()
Q. How to provide the data?//context.Provider value attribute
Q. How to provide the data?//context.Consumer with callback function

Q. What is useContext? //if we want to use context or consume with hooks
Q. useContext() takes how many arguments? //one what is that?// Context
Q. How to update state without setState()?
Q.
Q.What is forceUpdate()??
	//without setState() I want to update the state
Q.
Q.
Q.
Q.
Q.How many arguments reducer() method takes?//2
Q.What is 1st argument to reducer()?//state
Q.What is the 2nd argument to reducer()? //action
Q.From where reducer() will receive the 2nd argument action?	
	//from dispatch()
Q.How many ways we can get dispatch()?
Q.Why we go for React.Fragment?
Q.What is React.createElement()? Contains how many arguments? And what are they/
Q.Without jsx how we can create a component?
Q.What is this.props.children?
Q.How many ways we can handle exception?
Q.How many static life cycle methods are available in React?
Q.Why we cannot update setState() from within getDerivedStateFromError()?
	//my this is not available within the static context..
Q.When my getDerivedStateFromError() is going to trigger?
Q.Where we are going to override getDerivedStateFromError()?
Q.How many ways we can write setState()?//3 ways
Q.When we go for setState() with callback function?
	//my setState() is async..
	//If I want to perform some operation once my state is updated then we can do here..
Q.What variables are coming from React.Component?
Q.What is my lifecycle structure? For both class component and functional component?
Q.state updated life cycle methods are what??
Q.

Q.What is the structure of HOC?
Q.Why we go for HOC?//reusability
Q.What is React.createRef()?
Q.Why we go for forward reference?
Q.
Q.
Q.
Q. What is hook?
Q. How many hooks are available in React?
Q.How does React Hooks re-renders a function Component?
